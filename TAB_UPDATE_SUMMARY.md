# Tab Navigation Consistency Update

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully unified the tab navigation styles across your FridgeFinder app. Here's what was done:

### 1. Created a Shared Tab Navigation Component
- Already existed at `/components/shared/TabNavigation.tsx`
- Supports three variants: `pillow`, `compact`, and `full-width`
- Includes support for icons and badges

### 2. Updated All Screens to Use Shared Component

#### Recipes Screen (`/app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx`)
- Replaced custom `TabNavigation` with `SharedTabNavigation`
- Added icons for Suggested, Favorites, and Recent tabs
- Using the configured variant from `tabStyles.ts`

#### Sessions Screen (`/app/(tabs)/sessions.tsx`)
- Replaced `FilterHeader` component with `SharedTabNavigation`
- Added icons for Pending, Approved, and Rejected tabs
- Kept the "Clear" button functionality

#### Fridge Screen (`/components/fridge/FiltersSection.tsx`)
- Replaced `ExpiryFilters` component with `SharedTabNavigation`
- Added icons for All Items, Expiring Soon, and Expired tabs
- Maintains the collapsible filter section behavior

### 3. Created Configuration File
- Added `/config/tabStyles.ts` for centralized tab style configuration
- Allows easy experimentation with different styles globally or per-screen
- Includes icon configuration for all tabs

### 4. Documentation
- Created `TAB_NAVIGATION_README.md` with instructions on how to customize tab styles

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All tabs now use the same component and styling system
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to experiment with different styles by changing a single configuration
3. **Maintainability**: One component to maintain instead of multiple implementations
4. **Customization**: Can still have different styles per screen if desired

## How to Experiment

Simply edit `/config/tabStyles.ts`:

```typescript
// Try different global styles
export const DEFAULT_TAB_VARIANT: TabVariant = 'compact'; // or 'pillow' or 'full-width'

// Or mix styles per screen
export const TAB_VARIANTS = {
  recipes: 'pillow',
  sessions: 'compact',
  fridge: 'full-width',
};
```

## Components to Remove (Optional Cleanup)

These components are no longer used and can be safely deleted:
- `/components/recipes/TabNavigation.tsx`
- `/components/fridge/ExpiryFilters.tsx`
- `/components/sessions/FilterHeader.tsx` (keep the type export)
